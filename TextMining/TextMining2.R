# Now we load the required libraries. Only a couple of things to mention:

# Using the annotate function of the openNLP package requires to explicitly include the package name
# (i.e., NLP::annotate) due to a name clash with ggplot2
# Need to change the memory allocated to Java to avoid out-of-memory problems

# Needed for OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space 
library(rJava)
.jinit(parameters="-Xmx4g")
# If there are more memory problems, invoke gc() after the POS tagging
